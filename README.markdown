2009 redesign for VivaLinux!, VivaPHP!, VivaBSD! and VivaHardware!
==================================================================

Putting my very new design skills to the test I decided to make a big redesign for all my *Viva!* blog sites, mostly to get a cleaner look and a wider columns. This way, the sites should look better on 1024x768 screens and bigger, wich are the majority of my visitors nowadays.

The original designs where made using **The GIMP 2.4** and for the XHTML and CSS versions I used the awesome [Blueprint CSS Framework](http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/).

See the current state of the designs online now at:

* [VivaLinux!](http://www.vivalinux.com.ar/)
* [VivaHardware!](http://www.vivahardware.com.ar/) and
* [VivaPHP!](http://www.vivaphp.com.ar/)

I'll be happy to ear your comments,
